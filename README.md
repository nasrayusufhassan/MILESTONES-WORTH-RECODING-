## About
*Milestones in C* is a collection of beginner-friendly C programs that showcase my learning journey.  
This repository includes simple programs and small simulations that cover the basics of *variables, loops, conditions, functions, and input/output* in C.  

Each program is stored in its own file for clarity and ease of use.
